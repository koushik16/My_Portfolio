      <h2>Detailed Research</h2>
      <h3>Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum NLP</h3>
      <p>
        My research in quantum machine learning focuses on developing efficient quantum data encoding algorithms, 
        embedding circuits, and optimizing quantum circuits for error mitigation. I’m particularly interested in 
        how these techniques can enhance natural language processing applications.
      </p>
      <h3>Bioinformatics and Cancer Research</h3>
      <p>
        In bioinformatics, I am engaged in projects analyzing cancer drug synergy predictions using deep learning and 
        integrating omics data for insights into genomic interactions. My work leverages high-performance computing 
        to enable scalable analyses of large datasets.
      </p>
      <h3>Language Model Analysis and Vector Clustering</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve conducted extensive research on vector models, including Word2Vec and large language models such as GPT and Claude. 
        My projects involve clustering word embeddings with dimension reduction techniques like PCA, T-SNE, and Fisher’s Discriminant, 
        and analyzing contextual meanings captured at different transformer layers.
